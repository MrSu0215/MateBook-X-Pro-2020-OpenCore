## Introduction

This repo contains the files needed for getting macOS working on a **Huawei MateBook X Pro (2020 Edition)** laptop with OpenCore.
* This is intended to create a "fully" functional (as far as possible) hackintosh for the Huawei Matebook X Pro.
* The project can be considered **stable**.
* With each new release of macOS we need to resolve each new "minor issue" we run into. 
* If you would like to get started with creating a hackintosh on your MBXP but have non experience, I would highly recommend following [**Dortania's OpenCore Install guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and then returning here for troubleshooting or last improvements.


### Summary

- The **compatibility** is **very good** for the most part, most of the stuff works like it would on a real MacBook, including camera, audio, touchpad, iCloud services.
- The **experience** is **pleasant**, as the laptop is smooth and responsive under macOS Big Sur/Catalina.
- **Battery life** is **quite great** (from personal experience it **lasts from 4-6 hours** for light works depending on its age with a behaviour very similar to Windows 11.

(With the use of turbo boost disabled)

- The **Intel WiFi** card is soldered onto the motherboard, which means it can't be replaced with a Broadcom one, but the Intel card is now **functional albeit not operating at full speeds** (however it is fine for most use cases).
    * With the latest `AirportItlwm.kext` even **Handoff** and **Continuity** features are working, but with a very limited support for AirDrop and Apple Watch unlocking (see [Changelog for OpenIntelWireless release](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)).
    * For any issues about `AirportItlwm.kext` please refer first to [**OpenIntelWireless Troubleshooting page**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/Troubleshooting.html#kernel-extension-loading-status) and then to [**OpenIntelWireless Gitter Page**](https://gitter.im/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)


### Generate your own SMBIOS Information

For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. You need to generate your unique `SMBIOS` info by yourself (recommend to use [**CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)), and inject them into your `config.plist`.
- With every **EFI update** you retrieve from [here](https://github.com/RepoWeaver/MateBook-X-Pro-2020-Opencore/releases), please, remember to transfer **your Device details** under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` in your `config.plist`.

<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

1. **Intel Bluetooth** could not support some Bluetooth devices
2. **Touchscreen support is disabled by default** 
	
#### Fixing Internal Speakers (taken from gnodipac886):

By default macOS only uses 2 out of your 4 speakers which sound muffled and are missing a lot of the high frequencies.

Enable surround sound to get a way better audio experience.

- Open Audio MIDI Setup from applications
- Click on the "+" symbol on the bottom left corner
- Click "Create Muti-Output Device"
- Check both of the Built-in Output options
- Select the newly created device in the menu bar
- Enjoy your music!
